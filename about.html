    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I’m Bryan Jodon, a marketing consultant and inbound sales strategist based in Akron, Ohio. With over 18 years of experience leading high-performing sales teams at Charter Communications, I’ve helped drive millions in revenue while coaching agents to succeed in fast-paced, high-pressure environments.</p>

    <p>After serving in the U.S. Army and earning multiple commendation medals, I translated those leadership skills into business — and now into entrepreneurship. I bring together analytics, automation, and AI tools to help small businesses grow smarter, not just louder.</p>

    <p>I specialize in helping service-based businesses — from plumbers to coaches — improve their local visibility, generate better leads, and build a marketing system that actually works.</p>

    <h2>Why I Do This</h2>
    <p>Most small business owners are overwhelmed by digital marketing — confusing platforms, noisy tactics, wasted spend. I’ve seen it firsthand. That’s why I built this business: to cut through the noise and deliver real, measurable results using the same strategic thinking that led sales teams to success for nearly two decades.</p>
